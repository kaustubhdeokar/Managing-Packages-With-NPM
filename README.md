### Notes
> "package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"

>> The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API     changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. 

> Tilde Character
>> allows npm to install the latest PATCH for a dependency

> Caret
>> the caret (^) allows npm to install future updates as well. The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.
